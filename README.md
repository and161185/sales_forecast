# Sales Forecast

Sales Forecast is a personal project aimed at enhancing machine learning skills by developing predictive models for sales data. The goal of this project is to experiment with different forecasting techniques and improve data processing and model evaluation capabilities.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Implementation of various forecasting models.
- Performance evaluation and visualization of results.
- Experimentation with time-series forecasting techniques.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/and161185/sales_forecast.git
   cd sales_forecast
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script to train and evaluate forecasting models:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

### Configuration
- Modify `config.json` to adjust parameters for data processing and model training.
- Provide sales data in the `data/` directory.

## Future Enhancements

- Experiment with deep learning models.
- Optimize hyperparameters for better forecasting accuracy.
- Integrate external data sources to improve model performance.
